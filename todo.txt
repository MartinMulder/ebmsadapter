2.x.x:
/ implement Ping Service
/ implement MessageStatus Service
- implement MessageOrder
- implement syncReplyMode?
- implement ackRequested (mode=never)
- implement duplicateElimination (mode=never)
- implement Encoding?
- implement JMS Client interface?
- implement dynamic cxf outbound endpoints (request url has to be resolved from CPA)?
- configure DAO caching?
/ improve duplicate message handling
- store duplicate messages???

3.x.x:
- update adapter to Mule 3
- support additional protocols besides http(s), like mail, file, etc?
- store http response status code with ebms send event

considerations:
- change wsdl definition to one operation (containing all ebxml elements) and 'parse' message in Mule?
- replace cxf interface?
